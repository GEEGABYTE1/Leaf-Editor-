Word editor made in Python using Linked Lists.

Files can be saved on script.py itself. You can create physical files (any type) and edit 
them right through your word editor!

 
Each User has a different set of files. 

If any command does not work on your doc, please type "/select_user" to prompt commands. 
Do not worry if it asks for your user again!
