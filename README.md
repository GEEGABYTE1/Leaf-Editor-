- `/remove_user`: Removes a user from the word editor 
- `/select_user`: Choose a user 
- `/Home`: Access the "Home Page" of the program

# Extras 

Some commands must have other commands ran before. 

Commands involving files will work only if there is a logged in user. 

Some commands may not support other commands. For example, /remove_file does not support the /add file.

You can import other .txt files into the database. In order to do that, the files must be in the same directory as the program file.
